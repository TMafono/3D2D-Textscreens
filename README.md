This is a modified version of 3D2D Textscreens. All credit for this addon should go to the original author. I'll only take credit for the work I have done.

You can find the official verion here. https://github.com/Cherry/3D2D-Textscreens
## Special Thanks: 
* To TMafono.xyz#6666 for fixing the Textscreen restriction per usergroup.
* To TMafono.xyz#6666 again for showing me how loops work and giving me an example to go off of.
* You guessed it, TMafono.xyz#6666 again for sticking through with me when I had literally no sleep.
* Special thanks to the community for giving me the inspiration to continue this project.

## Very Important Features: 
* ULX(Anything that supports GetUserGroup) & Serverguard support.
    * You can set how many textscreens each rank can spawn.
    * Failsafe limit incase a rank wasn't configured or found.
* Disable analytics through the config.[Enable/Disable]
* Set a max character limit for a line on a textscreen.
* Display the players name below the textscreen.[Enable/Disable]
* Have a custom advertisement displayed below the players name.[Enable/Disable]

## Features: 
* Create 3D2D text anywhere in the world 
* Rotate and manipulate this text simply via your physgun 
* Up to 5 lines of text 
* Multiple different fonts, font sizes, and colours.
* Heavily optimised
  * Full scale testing on a highly popular RP server.
  * Draw distance optimisations(Customizable).
  * Minimal FPS hit.
* Permanent text screens.
  * Hold C for context menu, right click on the textscreen, and make the text screen permanent (only works for admins). This is perfect for welcome messages or rules.
* Presets
  * Define preset textscreen data (size, text, colours, etc) and save/load these for future use at any time. This is very useful to trying to replicate multiple textscreens across maps.


## Server owners:
* Use the textscreens_config.lua to change configuration options.
